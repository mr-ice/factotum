fac·to·tum
    /fakˈtōtəm/
    noun
    an employee who does all kinds of work.
    "he was employed as the general factotum"
    synonyms:	handyman, jack of all trades; assistant, man Friday, gal/girl
                Friday; gofer; informal Mr./Ms. Fix-It


factotum is concieved as a simple service that can run on a linux-like
platform.  It will provide a HTTP interface to run commands on the
machine it is running as, as the user it is running as.

This could be used, for example, to let a service account on one machine
hand off a task to a service account on a different machine.

Originally we targeted this as a mechanism where a git trigger that can cause a
remote server to perform a git pull as a completely different user.  This is to
avoid the classic solution using a passwordless SSH with a passwordless SUDO
command.

Is this like:
  jenkins - 
    No, because jenkins runs as a web service on one machine and to cross
    privilege boundaries needs help (usually sudo or ssh).  
  oddjob -
    No, because factotum runs commands that the server configures, oddjob allows
    the client to configure jobs for the server (arbitrarily).
  webmin -
    Closer, but no, because factotum doesn't need to run as root, and is
    specialized, webmin is much more general purpose.  Also we envision REST
    APIs and not XML-RPC over HTTP to simplify calling from scripts like in a
    git post-commit hook.
